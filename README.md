# Portfolio

## This repo is housing my personal developer portfolio created in Code Fellows 301.

### Feature #1: Refactor the CSS

Estimate of time needed to complete: 1 hour

Start time: 8pm

Finish time: 9:30pm

Actual time needed to complete: 1 hour, 30 minutes

##### Why are we implementing this feature?

As a user, I want the portfolio to have a clean UI so that it is visually appealing.

##### What are we going to implement?

Given that a user opens the application in the browser
When the user navigates to the home page
Then the portfolio contents should be displayed

#### How are we implementing it?

Refactor the main.css file using SMACSS principles.
You may decide how many files to include, but at the minimum should include base.css, layout.css, and modules.css. However, think through the way you separate your CSS rules. For example, you may want several CSS files in a modules folder, if you feel that the code needs to be organized in that manner.

### Feature #2: Modify the contents

Estimate of time needed to complete: 1 hour

Start time: 9:30pm

##### Why are we implementing this feature?

As a user, I want to view a unique portfolio so that the skills and personality of the developer are portrayed.

##### What are we going to implement?

Given that a user opens the application in the browser
When the user navigates to the home page
Then the content should be unique and reflect the skills and personality of the developer

##### How are we implementing it?

Modify the contents of the template to make it your own. The HTML elements may remain the same if you like, but the content should be adapted to reflect your personal details and skills.
Apply the following changes, some of which were part of your prework for this course:
Next to the header image, add your name and a short, 2-3 word title.
In the Intro section, add a personal headline. This should be the same as or similar to your headline on your LinkedIn profile.
In the Portfolio section, state what you are excited about in tech. Add links to projects and include placeholders for future 301 and 401 projects. If you would like, you can add links to sites such as LinkedIn and GitHub here, or social sites.
In the About Me section, add your personal pitch and banner photo.
Add you own color scheme and Google fonts.
Change the content and images to reflect your personal preferences. If you are using online images, make sure they are licensed for free, commercial use. For example, Unsplash has a nice variety of free images.
Update the list of social media icons with your links using icons for your favorite social media sites from IcoMoon or Font Awesome.
Keep in mind that this template is just a starting point. It is yours to modify to reflect your personal online presence as a software developer so have fun and be creative!
